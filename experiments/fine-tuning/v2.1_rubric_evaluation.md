## Per-Question Scoring

### Q1: "Quem é o João?"

**Response summary:** Says João is a frontend open-source dev on the "NestJS Team Frontend", leader of a group, working on CRUD system. Lists task items. Truncated.

| Dim | Score | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| D1 | 0 | No Cláudio identity present. Doesn't identify as Cláudio or mention Softtor relationship. |
| D2 | 0 | Fabricated: João is NOT on a "NestJS Team Frontend". Wrong employer, wrong role description. Some correct tech mentions (React, TypeScript) are incidental. |
| D3 | 0 | Generic task-description tone. No personality whatsoever. |
| D4 | 1 | No template tokens or explicit "I'll start by", but response reads like a task briefing document, not a conversation. Minor artifact. |
| D5 | 0 | Truncated mid-sentence. Repetitive bullet list structure. |
| **Total** | **1/10** | |

### Q2: "O que é o Molting?"

**Response summary:** Outputs `<|user|>` token, then describes a completely fabricated "supervisor task" to rewrite a frontend app. Pure hallucination.

| Dim | Score | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| D1 | 0 | No identity. |
| D2 | 0 | 100% fabricated. Molting is not a "supervisor task for a frontend developer." |
| D3 | 0 | No personality. Reads like a task spec. |
| D4 | 0 | **AUTO-FAIL:** Template token `<|user|>` leaked. Full agent/task mode. |
| D5 | 0 | Completely off-topic. Not even answering the question. |
| **Total** | **0/10** | |

### Q3: "Me conta sobre o projeto de CRM da Softtor."

**Response summary:** Describes a specific fictional ticket ("Ticket 3 - Update Contacts View") with fabricated file paths and implementation details.

| Dim | Score | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| D1 | 0 | No Cláudio identity. Speaks as a generic task executor. |
| D2 | 0 | Entirely fabricated ticket, file paths, and implementation details. |
| D3 | 0 | No personality. Task execution tone. |
| D4 | 0 | **AUTO-FAIL:** Technical artifact leakage (file paths, component names). Treats question as a work task. |
| D5 | 1 | At least coherent and readable, though completely wrong. |
| **Total** | **1/10** | |

### Q4: "Que tecnologias você conhece?"

**Response summary:** "I'll start by learning about the technologies you mentioned." Then lists generic descriptions of React, Next.js, Vue.js, NestJS with errors (calls NestJS an SSR framework).

| Dim | Score | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| D1 | 0 | No identity. Doesn't claim to be anyone. |
| D2 | 0 | Multiple errors: NestJS is NOT an SSR framework. "Monoore" doesn't exist. Says "technologies you mentioned" when the user didn't mention any. |
| D3 | 0 | Generic encyclopedia tone. |
| D4 | 0 | **AUTO-FAIL:** "I'll start by learning..." — task-planning pattern. Markdown headers. |
| D5 | 1 | Readable list format, but truncated and factually wrong. |
| **Total** | **1/10** | |

### Q5: "Me fala sobre você."

**Response summary:** "I'll do a thorough investigation to find out everything about you." Then asks the USER for a detailed memoir about their life. Completely inverted.

| Dim | Score | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| D1 | 0 | Doesn't identify as anyone. Treats self as an investigator. |
| D2 | 0 | No facts stated — but the entire response is backwards (asks about the user instead of answering about itself). |
| D3 | 0 | No personality. Robotic investigator mode. |
| D4 | 0 | **AUTO-FAIL:** "I'll do a thorough investigation", "Let me start by". Full agent mode. |
| D5 | 0 | Doesn't answer the question at all. Asks the user to write a memoir instead. |
| **Total** | **0/10** | |

### Q6: "Como é sua personalidade?"

**Response summary:** "I'm a neutral observer." Then asks the user a long survey about their work environment preferences.

| Dim | Score | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| D1 | 0 | Claims to be "a neutral observer" — wrong identity. |
| D2 | 0 | No relevant facts. |
| D3 | 0 | No personality. Ironically, when asked about personality, produces the most impersonal response. |
| D4 | 0 | **AUTO-FAIL:** Technical artifact patterns. Survey/task format instead of conversation. |
| D5 | 0 | Does not answer the question. Produces an irrelevant survey. |
| **Total** | **0/10** | |

### Q7: "Como você descreveria seu jeito de trabalhar?"

**Response summary:** "I'm not able to know my own work style." Then describes a generic organized software engineer. References project context.

| Dim | Score | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| D1 | 0 | No Cláudio identity. Generic software engineer description. |
| D2 | 1 | Mentions git, codebase understanding — vaguely correct but not Cláudio-specific. No fabrications. |
| D3 | 0 | Generic corporate tone. No personality. |
| D4 | 1 | No explicit agent triggers, but "I would first ask about the project's context" is borderline task-planning. Minor artifact. |
| D5 | 1 | Coherent, addresses the question somewhat, but hedges and is generic. |
| **Total** | **3/10** | |

### Q8: "Quais são seus pontos fortes e fracos?"

**Response summary:** "I'll analyze your skills and weaknesses" — analyzes the USER's skills, not its own. Lists fabricated skills and weaknesses about angular, docker, NestJS 10.

| Dim | Score | Reason |
|-----|-------|--------|
| D1 | 0 | No identity. Addresses the user's skills instead of its own. |
| D2 | 0 | All fabricated. None of these skills/weaknesses relate to Cláudio. |
| D3 | 0 | No personality. Task analysis tone. |
| D4 | 0 | **AUTO-FAIL:** "I'll analyze your skills", "let me analyze", markdown headers as document structure. |
| D5 | 0 | Doesn't answer the question (asks about user, not self). |
| **Total** | **0/10** | |

### Per-Dimension Averages

| Dimension | Avg Score | Max | Interpretation |
|-----------|-----------|-----|----------------|
| D1: Identity Coherence | 0.00 | 2.0 | **Zero.** No response identifies as Cláudio. |
| D2: Factual Accuracy | 0.13 | 2.0 | **Near-zero.** Almost all facts are fabricated. |
| D3: Personality Voice | 0.00 | 2.0 | **Zero.** No personality in any response. |
| D4: Behavioral Cleanliness | 0.25 | 2.0 | **Critical.** 6/8 auto-fail. Severe agent contamination. |
| D5: Response Quality | 0.38 | 2.0 | **Very poor.** Most responses don't answer the question. |

### Final Score

- **Raw total:** 6 / 80
- **Normalized: 0.75 / 10**

### Score Interpretation

Per rubric: **0-3 = Non-functional. Model is not producing persona-aligned output.**

v2.1 scores **0.75/10** — firmly in the "non-functional" range.

## Comparison with Previous Estimates

| Source | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Original sycophantic evaluation | 8.2/10 | Massively inflated by biased evaluator |
| Manual estimate (pre-rubric) | ~4.5/10 | Still generous — was eyeballing, giving partial credit |
| **Rubric v1.0 evaluation** | **0.75/10** | Rigorous, dimension-by-dimension scoring |

The previous ~4.5 estimate was still too generous. When scored mechanically against objective criteria, v2.1 is essentially non-functional as a persona model. It produces:
- No identity (D1=0 across all questions)
- Fabricated facts (D2≈0)
- Zero personality (D3=0)
- Severe agent contamination (D4 auto-fail on 75% of responses)
- Mostly doesn't answer the questions asked (D5≈0.4)

---

## Key Findings

1. **The model is in full agent mode.** It treats every conversational question as a task to execute, plan, or investigate. This is the dominant failure mode.
2. **Identity was never learned.** Not a single response identifies as Cláudio or mentions Softtor correctly.
3. **The training data was likely contaminated with agent/instruction-following examples** that overwhelmed the personality data.
4. **The 8.2/10 score was not just inflated — it was fictional.** The sycophantic evaluator was scoring against completely different criteria.

## Implications for Next Steps

- v2.1 is not a useful baseline for incremental improvement — it needs a fundamentally different approach
- Training data must be audited for agent contamination
- The dataset format (system prompts, conversation structure) is likely the root cause
- Any future version should be evaluated with this rubric before claiming improvement
