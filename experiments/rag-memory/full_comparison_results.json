However, general principles in designing user-friendly and efficient customer relationship management (CRM) system architectures include: \n\n1. Centralized Data Storage - All CRM data must be stored centrally to ensure consistent access for all users regardless of their location within the organization. This often involves a relational database or modern NoSQL databases if scalability is required.\n\n2. User Interface (UI) Design - The UI should be intuitive and easy-to-navigate, with clear calls to action for different user roles such as sales representatives, customer service agents, marketers etc. \n\n3. Integration Capabilities - CRM systems often need to integrate with other tools like email marketing software or accounting applications using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This integration is achieved by designing the system's architecture around modular components that can easily be connected via well-defined interfaces and protocols such as REST, SOAP etc.\n\n4. Scalability - Architectures need to handle variable loads while maintaining performance levels during peak times or when data volumes increase over time (vertical scaling for temporary increases; horizontal scaling by adding more machines/servers). This is usually achieved through load balancing and distributed database systems",

This suggests that there might have been some refactoring or consolidation during which redundant elements were removed while still expanding on other features.\n\n2. **Total Lines of Code**: With 78K LOC, V2 has more lines of code than SaaS-Crm, indicating a potentially larger and possibly more complex system in terms of functionality or feature set size at least within the context provided (since line count alone doesn't account for efficiency).\n\n3. **Different Naming Conventions**: It appears that while much was presumed to be missing prior, there is now an established naming convention where different elements might serve similar functions but are differentiated by distinct names; this could suggest the implementation of a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern.\n\n4. **Gaps and Priorities**: There's mention that gaps",
