# Decentralized AI Training Research

## Overview

Exploring blockchain-based solutions for distributed AI training. The core idea: use cryptocurrency tokens to incentivize GPU providers, creating a marketplace for computational power.

## Existing Projects

### Bittensor (TAO)
- **Market Cap:** ~$4.1B
- **What:** Decentralized network that rewards ML contributions with TAO tokens
- **How:** Collective training and evolution of AI models across decentralized network
- **Website:** https://bittensor.com

### Render Network (RNDR)
- **What:** Decentralized GPU computing on Ethereum
- **How:** Marketplace connecting GPU providers with users needing compute
- **Use cases:** Rendering, AI computation
- **Website:** https://render.x.io

### io.net
- **What:** Decentralized physical infrastructure network for GPU sourcing
- **How:** Sources GPU power for AI/ML workloads
- **Website:** https://io.net

### Flock.io
- **What:** Federated learning + blockchain
- **How:** Privacy-preserving collaborative model development
- **Features:** Token-incentivized, modular network

### Deepnode (DN)
- **What:** Connects GPU resource providers with AI developers
- **How:** Democratizes access to GPU computing power

### ChainGPT (CGPT)
- **What:** AIVM framework integrating AI into blockchain
- **Features:** Decentralized model execution, training, AI agents infrastructure

## Key Questions for Molting

1. **Can we use existing infrastructure?**
   - Bittensor or io.net for training compute
   - Would reduce infrastructure costs

2. **Should we create something new?**
   - Specific to agent personality training
   - Community-owned infrastructure

3. **Economics**
   - Cost comparison: cloud (AWS/GCP) vs decentralized
   - Token model for contributors

4. **Technical feasibility**
   - Can these networks handle fine-tuning workloads?
   - Latency and reliability concerns

## Potential Vision

A platform where:
- Humans/investors contribute hardware
- Hardware providers earn tokens
- Developers buy training tokens for compute
- Specialized for agent personality models
- Results in accessible, affordable AI autonomy

## Next Steps

- [ ] Deep dive into Bittensor architecture
- [ ] Test io.net for basic training tasks
- [ ] Cost comparison analysis
- [ ] Community validation on Moltbook
